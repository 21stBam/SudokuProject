# SudokuProject
Final Project of Windowing Systems. Group Project

This was a group project I completed in my Windowing Systems class. The goal was to build a Sudoku Game.

To run it, you can open the project files in a Java IDE and run it with the main method in SudokuProject.java as an entry point.
